Hi! I’m Catherine Braguina,\ 
a **3-year-old data analyst** who aspires to become a **data scientist** in the future. \

🤓 I studied ***law, economics, and management*** at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, and have further developed my skills working in large businesses such as BMW, METRO CASH&CARRY, and TENNECO.\

👩🏼‍💻 My journey into the world of analytics began with Excel, but as the volume of data increased, I felt the need to learn Python and SQL.\
Currently, I am continuing my studies in Python programming while working as a data analyst.

🌟 My goal for 2024 is to requalify as a Data Analyst and continue my professional growth in the field.

In addition to my technical skills in Excel (Power Pivot, Power Query, Analysis), Power BI, Tableau, Kibana, Super Set, SQL and Python, I also possess soft skills such as diplomacy and negotiation skills.\ 

🌚 I have a presence on [VC.ru] (https://vc.ru/u/2944366-katerina-bragina) where I share my insights and experiences in the field of data analysis.

🌸 Thank you for the opportunity to connect and showcase my skills. \

💫 I look forward to potential opportunities to further develop my career as a data analyst and ultimately transition into the role of a data scientist.
