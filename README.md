Hi! I’m Catherine Braguina,\ 
a **3-year-old data analyst** who aspires to become a **data scientist** in the future. \
I studied law, economics, and management at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, and have further developed my skills working in large businesses such as BMW, METRO CASH&CARRY, and TENNECO.\
My journey into the world of analytics began with Excel, but as the volume of data increased, I felt the need to learn Python and SQL.\
Currently, I am continuing my studies in Python programming while working as a data analyst.

My goal for 2024 is to requalify as a Data Analyst and continue my professional growth in the field.

In addition to my technical skills in Excel, Power BI, Tableau, SQL, and Python, I also possess soft skills such as diplomacy and negotiation skills.\ 
I have a presence on [VC.ru] (https://vc.ru/u/2944366-katerina-bragina) where I share my insights and experiences in the field of data analysis.

Thank you for the opportunity to connect and showcase my skills. \
I look forward to potential opportunities to further develop my career as a data analyst and ultimately transition into the role of a data scientist.
